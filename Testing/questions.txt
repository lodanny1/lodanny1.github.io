Got it. I’ll tailor this to what you’ve actually shipped so far: Cognito login, S3 upload/download, and a “Your Documents” view backed by DynamoDB—and I’ll also note how it evolves when you add EventBridge/Step Functions/Lambda.
1) Scalability: serverless vs traditional servers
Serverless today (your current footprint):
Cognito Hosted UI scales automatically for logins (no auth servers for you to run).
S3 scales essentially without intervention for object storage and serving downloads (multi-AZ, massive request concurrency).
DynamoDB (On-Demand) can scale to thousands of requests per second automatically; hot partitions are mitigated by good key design.
Amplify hosting auto-scales globally at the edge; no web server capacity planning.
Traditional servers would require:
Sizing/auto-scaling groups, patching AMIs, tuning Nginx/Node pool sizes, load testing, and scale-out/caching layers.
Stateful auth servers or custom OIDC brokers, token storage, session replication.
File servers or EFS/EBS, throughput planning, and cross-AZ replication.
A DB cluster with read replicas and manual sharding once write throughput rises.
Bottom line: your current serverless design scales horizontally by default, without you owning instances. When you add EventBridge → Step Functions → Lambda, those also scale with demand (subject to concurrency and account quotas), preserving the same scale characteristics.
2) Bottlenecks & how to fix them
Likely pressure points (now and later):
S3 request spikes (uploads/downloads):
Mitigation: use multipart uploads for large files; use presigned URLs (you do already) so the web tier isn’t a bottleneck; optionally S3 Transfer Acceleration for long-haul uploads.
DynamoDB hot partition / uneven keys:
Mitigation: choose a high-cardinality partition key (e.g., fileId or projectId#fileKey), avoid timestamps as PK. If you need “latest 20 per project,” use GSI on projectId + createdAt.
DynamoDB read costs/latency at scale:
Mitigation: enable caching on the frontend for list views, paginate with LastEvaluatedKey, use strong vs eventual consistency only where required, and consider DAX only if read latency becomes a true bottleneck.
Lambda concurrency (once you add processing):
Mitigation: configure reserved concurrency per function; use SQS between S3 and Lambda for smoothing bursts; set maxReceiveCount + DLQ; shard by key to avoid hotspots.
Step Functions state transition volume (later):
Mitigation: combine related steps where appropriate; use Map state concurrency controls; push heavy CPU tasks to Fargate (ECS) if Lambda time/memory is limiting.
API Gateway rate limits (when added):
Mitigation: enable usage plans + API keys or Cognito authorizers with throttling; consider regional endpoints + CloudFront for fan-out.
3) Data consistency & failure handling
What you have now:
S3 ↔ DynamoDB consistency: make writes idempotent. When adding processing, use the S3 Object Version ID and store it in DynamoDB; on re-processing or duplicate events, perform a conditional write (e.g., “only write if versionId is not present”).
Transactions: for multi-item updates (e.g., update file row & an index row), use DynamoDB Transactions (TransactWriteItems).
Retries & backoff: clients (upload, list) and backend (later Lambdas) should use exponential backoff + jitter.
Poison pills: introduce SQS + DLQ between S3 events and processors; Step Functions has per-state retries and Catch blocks—send failures to a DLQ or a “dead letter” DynamoDB table for manual replays.
Exactly-once semantics (pragmatic): rely on idempotency keys (e.g., fileId#versionId), conditional writes, and dedupe checks before heavy processing.
Observability: create CloudWatch alarms for: DynamoDB throttles, 4xx/5xx from the API (when added), Lambda error rates/timeouts, and Step Functions failures.
4) Security measures (immediate + near-term)
Data in transit & at rest
S3: Block Public Access (account + bucket). Require aws:SecureTransport (true) in bucket policy. Use SSE-S3 now; consider SSE-KMS with a customer-managed key later (fine-grained key access, revocation).
DynamoDB: encryption at rest enabled (default). Limit IAM to only actions needed.
Presigned URLs: short expirations (minutes), restrict method & key; for uploads, set conditions (max size, content-type) and deny x-amz-acl: public-read.
Identity & access
Cognito: Hosted UI with Authorization Code + PKCE (you already use). Scope down tokens; verify audience (client_id) and issuer on backend (when you add API).
IAM: least privilege policies, one role per function/service. Deny wildcards in prod. Consider permission boundaries for future contributors.
API (when added): use Cognito authorizer (JWT), enable WAF (bot, SQLi/XSS managed rules), set CORS only to your Amplify domain.
Network posture
When you add private processing: VPC endpoints for S3/DynamoDB, so Lambdas don’t traverse public internet. Keep buckets private; never open S3 to the world.
Monitoring & audit
CloudTrail (org-level, if possible), GuardDuty for anomaly detection, Macie for PII discovery in S3, Access Analyzer for unintended public access, and Config rules for drift.
5) Supporting different file types & richer extraction
Routing by type
Store contentType and/or sniff via Lambda (e.g., magic bytes). In Step Functions, branch:
PDF → AWS Textract (forms/tables), extract title/author, page count.
Images → Rekognition (labels, moderation), EXIF.
Audio/Video → MediaInfo/ffprobe on Fargate (long-running CPU), or MediaConvert for standardized metadata & thumbnails.
CSV/JSON/Parquet → schema inspect (headers, row count, column types), store a compact summary; optionally validate with Glue DataBrew or AWS Glue ETL.
Extensibility pattern:
Put “handlers” behind an event bus or Step Functions Map with ItemReader; each handler writes a normalized metadata envelope to DynamoDB (e.g., core + typeSpecific JSON).
For large/slow jobs, emit a “processing started” status, then “completed/failed” with timestamps.
Performance for big files
Prefer server-side streaming (range reads) for headers only. Don’t download entire files into Lambda memory. For heavy work, offload to Fargate with ephemeral EBS and IAM-scoped role.
6) Cost implications & optimizations (for what you’ve built)
Current cost drivers (today):
S3: storage ($/GB-month), PUT/GET requests, and data transfer out (downloads).
Save: enable lifecycle to Glacier Instant/Flexible/Deep for stale objects; compress text assets; avoid unnecessary GETs by caching object metadata in your UI state.
DynamoDB: if using On-Demand, you pay per request; small and predictable load can be cheaper than provisioned.
Save: keep items compact; avoid hot scans; use query + pagination; TTL for “soft-delete” rows.
Cognito: monthly MAU pricing—cheap at PoC scale.
Amplify: hosting + build minutes (minimal).
CloudWatch Logs: tiny but can grow—use log retention (e.g., 30–90 days)
